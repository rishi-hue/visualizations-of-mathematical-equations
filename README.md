# visualizations-of-mathematical-equations

This project involves creating a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input mathematical equations in a standard format, and then generating a visual representation of the equation using a library like JavaFX or Swing.

I started by creating a simple GUI with input fields for the mathematical equation and the range of values to use for the visualization. I then used a  Apache Commons Math to parse the input equation and evaluate it at each point in the specified range. I used JavaFX to draw the resulting graph on the screen.
